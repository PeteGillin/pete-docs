# Norton's Dome: some thoughts

## Introduction

Norton's Dome is a thought experiment proposed in 2003 by John D Norton, a philosopher of physics. It purports to show that Newtonian mechanics exhibit both non-determinism and non-causality. If you're not familiar with it, I recommend reading the write-up on [write-up on his site][Norton]. It's short and accessible.

This page contains my thoughts on the subject. I'll give my view on the claims, and on some of the other responses out there (though I'll only scratch the surface). And I'll share some ideas which I haven't seen elsewhere (though my research has been far from exhaustive).

## Continuity saves the day

The most important point to make is that the class of non-trivial solutions to the equations of motion which Norton presents are only possible because his dome has a singularity at its apex. I believe that the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations guarantees that Newtonian mechanics will be deterministic when the boundary conditions are continuous. I recommend reading [David B Malament][Malament] for more on that.

I also believe that this restores causality (because if one solution involving spontaneous movement is possible then a whole class of such solutions must be — there is, at least, a degree of freedom in when the movement happens; and in this case there is also a degree of freedom in the direction of the movement — and that would violate uniqueness).

I would argue that, from a practical physics point of view, we lose none of the utility of Newtonian mechanics by restricting its use to situations with continuous boundary condititions. We already know that it is an approximation to reality, and specifically that it does not apply at subatomic scales where quantum effects become important. So, to use Newtonian mechanics, we are replacing real surfaces made out of atoms with idealized ones, and we can just as easily choose a continuous one as a discontinous one.
