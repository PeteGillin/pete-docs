# Norton's Dome: some thoughts

## Introduction

Norton's Dome is a thought experiment proposed in 2003 by John D Norton, a philosopher of physics. It purports to show that Newtonian mechanics exhibit both non-determinism and non-causality. If you're not familiar with it, I recommend reading the write-up on [write-up on his site][Norton]. It's short and accessible.

This page contains my thoughts on the subject. I'll give my view on the claims, and on some of the other responses out there (though I'll only scratch the surface). And I'll share some ideas which I haven't seen elsewhere (though my research has been far from exhaustive).
